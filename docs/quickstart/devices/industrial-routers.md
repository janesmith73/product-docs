Newer firmware version of the Teltonika Routers should automatically detect the emnify APN.
Nevertheless, in case the APN is not correctly detected, it can be configured with 3 methods:

1. With the Teltonika WebUI over Wifi, Ethernet
1. Via the SMS console through the [**Connected Devices** page of the emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/connected-devices)
1. via the emnify SMS API or Zapier Integration (when automating the configuration)


**APN configuration through the Teltonika Router WebUI**

1. Connect your PC through the routers Wi-Fi using the credentials   provided on the device.
1. Open the Teltonika WebUI <http://192.168.1.1> and go to the Mobile configuration.
1. Type in `em` in APN – there is no PIN configured on the SIM and no APN username or password required.
