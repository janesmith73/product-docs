# OpenVPN

emnify's communication platform hosts an OpenVPN service that allows you to establish a private network between a device and any remote client location. 
The remote client can be on the application server or any machine that wants to access the device remotely (such as operational staff).

## IoT device requirements

Your IoT device doesn't need a private APN, OpenVPN software, or dynamic DNS resolution to use the OpenVPN service.
Through the emnify SIM, each device will have a [static](/glossary#static-ip) [private IP address](/glossary#private-ip) that you can use to identify and address the device.

At the same time, the IoT device can send data through the private tunnel to the IP address of the remote machine.

## Setting up OpenVPN using the emnify Portal

The following steps are required to set up OpenVPN on your machine:

1. In the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) → [**Device Policies**](https://portal.emnify.com/device-policies): Set the **Service Policy** to a VPN breakout region, e.g., `eu-west-1 (VPN)`

1. Select your operating system and install the OpenVPN software.
1. Download and store the VPN configuration file for your region.

Create the `credentials.txt` file as instructed, using either your [user credentials](https://portal.emnify.com/user-settings) or your [organization ID](https://portal.emnify.com/organisation-settings/details) and [application token](https://portal.emnify.com/integrations#application-tokens) (recommended)
1. Follow the remaining steps in the Portal to start the OpenVPN application or service on your operating system.
